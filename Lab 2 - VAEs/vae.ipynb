Recall from C147/C247, an autoencoder seeks to learn a latent representation of our training images by using unlabeled data and learning to reconstruct its inputs. The *variational autoencoder* extends this model by adding a probabilistic spin to the encoder and decoder, allowing us to sample from the learned distribution of the latent space to generate new images at inference time."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JtA1_PsYhs24"},"source":["## Setup Code\n","Before getting started, we need to run some boilerplate code to set up our environment.
